        <h1><u><b>1.HTML</b></u></h1>
        <p><h3>HTML [ Hypertext Markup Language ] is the standard markup language used to create and structure documents on
            the web. It forms the foundation of web development by defining the structure and layout of web content,
            including text, images, links, forms, and multimedia resources. HTML documents are interpreted by web
            browsers to render web pages that users can view and interact with.</h3></p>
        <p><h3>Here's a comprehensive introduction to HTML</h3></p>

        <div class="summary">
            <details>
                <summary><u>Read More About HTML &#x1F447;</u></summary>


                <p><h2>Overview of HTML:</h2></p>
                <p><h3>1. Purpose: HTML serves as the backbone of web pages, defining the elements and their relationships
                    within a document. It enables web browsers to interpret and display content correctly, ensuring
                    consistency and accessibility across different platforms and devices.</h3></p>
                <p><h3>2. History: HTML was first developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a means to share documents over
                    the internet. It has since evolved through various versions, with HTML5 being the latest major
                    iteration, introducing new features and capabilities to meet modern web development needs</h3></p>
                <p><h3>3. Basic Structure: An HTML document is a plain text file with a '.html' extension. It consists of
                    elements defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets ('<>'). Tags typically come in pairsâ€”an opening
                        tag ['opening<>'] and a closing tag ['closing</>]', with content nested between them.</h3></p>
                <p><h3>4. Elements and Attributes: HTML elements represent different parts of a web page, such as headings
                    (h1 to h6), paragraphs (p), lists (ul, ol, li), links (a), images (img), forms (form, input,
                    button), and more. Attributes provide additional information about elements and are specified within
                    the opening tag (tag attribute="value").</h3></p>
                <p><h3>5. Document Structure: Every HTML document begins with a [!DOCTYPE] declaration to specify the HTML
                    version. It includes an [html] element that encapsulates the entire document, comprising [head] and
                    [body] sections. [head] contains meta-information about the document (e.g., title, character
                    encoding), while [body] holds the visible content (e.g., text, images, links).</h3></p>
                <p><h3>6. Semantic Markup: HTML5 introduced semantic elements like [header], [nav], [section], [article],
                    [footer], and [aside], which clarify the structure and purpose of content for both browsers and
                    developers.</h3></p>
                <p><h3>7. Document Object Model (DOM): When an HTML document is loaded in a web browser, it is parsed into
                    a structured representation called the Document Object Model (DOM). This model allows scripts (like
                    JavaScript) to dynamically interact with the content and structure of the web page.</h3></p>
                <p><h3>8. Integration with CSS and JavaScript: HTML works seamlessly with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for
                    styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity. Together, these technologies form the core
                    trio of web development, allowing for dynamic and visually appealing web pages.</h3></p>

                        tags.</li></h3></p>
                <p><h3><li>Compatibility: HTML is supported by all modern web browsers, ensuring consistent rendering

                <p><h3><li>Resources: Numerous resources such as tutorials, documentation, and online courses are available
                        for learning HTML, catering to beginners and experienced developers alike.</li></h3></p>
                <p><h3>HTML remains essential for web development, providing the structural foundation that underpins the
                    visual and interactive aspects of the web. As technology advances, HTML continues to evolve to meet
                    the demands of modern web development practices and standards.</h3></p>

        <h1 id="C2"><u><b>2.CSS</b></u></h1>
        <p><h3>CSS [ Cascading Style Sheets ] is a fundamental technology used to control the presentation and layout of
            web pages. It works alongside HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and JavaScript to define how HTML elements
            are displayed on screen, enabling web developers to create visually appealing and responsive websites.</h3></p>

                <p><h2>Overview of CSS:</h2></p>
                <p><h3>1. Purpose: CSS is designed to separate the content and structure (HTML) from the presentation
                    (styling and layout). By defining styles for HTML elements, CSS allows developers to control aspects
                    such as color, font, spacing, and positioning across multiple web pages or even entire websites.</h3></p>
                <p><h3>2. History: CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos in 1994 as a means to style web
                    documents. It became a W3C recommendation in 1996 and has since undergone several revisions, with
                    CSS3 being the latest major version.</h3></p>
                <p><h3>3. Basic Structure: CSS operates on a selector and declaration basis. Selectors target HTML elements
                    (e.g., `h1`, `p`, `.class`, `#id`) and declarations define the style rules applied to those elements
                    (e.g., `color: blue;`, `font-size: 16px;`, `margin: 10px;`). CSS rules are typically stored in
                    separate .css files or embedded directly within HTML documents using `style` tags.</h3></p>
                <p><h3>4. Cascading and Specificity: The term "cascading" in CSS refers to how styles are applied in a
                    hierarchical order, allowing for flexibility and inheritance. Specificity determines which styles
                    take precedence when multiple rules apply to the same element, based on selector specificity (inline
                    styles > IDs > classes > elements).</h3></p>
                <p><h3>5. Box Model: CSS treats each HTML element as a box, consisting of content, padding, border, and
                    margin. Understanding and manipulating the box model is crucial for controlling spacing and layout
                    in web design.</h3></p>
                <p><h3>6. Responsive Design: CSS plays a vital role in creating responsive websites that adapt to different
                    screen sizes and devices. Media queries in CSS enable developers to apply different styles based on
                    factors like screen width, pixel density, and orientation.</h3></p>

        <p><h2>### Overview of JavaScript:</h2></p>
        <p><h3>1. History: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications
            Corporation. Originally named Mocha, it was later renamed to LiveScript and finally JavaScript. Despite its
            name, JavaScript shares only a few superficial similarities with Java. It became an ECMA (European Computer
            Manufacturers Association) standard in 1997 and is now officially known as ECMAScript, with regular updates
            to the language specification.</h3></p>
        <p><h3>2. Features:
            <li>Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is primarily used as a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs
                on the user's web browser rather than on the web server. This allows for interactive and responsive web
                pages.</li>
            <li>Dynamic Content: JavaScript enables developers to manipulate the HTML DOM (Document Object Model),
                allowing for dynamic changes to web page content, structure, and style in response to user actions or
                other events.</li>
            <li>Event-Driven Programming: JavaScript uses event listeners to execute code in response to events such as
                mouse clicks, keyboard input, page loading, and more, making web pages interactive and engaging.</li>
            <li>Cross-platform Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, ensuring consistent
                behavior across different platforms and devices.</li>
            <li>Versatility: JavaScript is not limited to client-side scripting; it is also used for server-side
                development (Node.js), mobile app development (React Native), game development, and more.</li></h3></p>
